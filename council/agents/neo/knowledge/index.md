# Neo's Knowledge Base

*Add coding resources, tutorials, docs, and technical references here.*

## How to use

- **Links:** Paste URLs to docs, articles, or tutorials. Neo will use them for technical questions.
- **Files:** Place `.md` files (summaries, snippets, conventions) in this folder.
- **Book notes:** Add key takeaways from programming books as markdown — more useful than raw PDFs.
