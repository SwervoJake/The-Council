AI Agent Council Setup Guide

Here’s a full, step-by-step setup plan for your Agent Council Infrastructure integrating all phases, models, agents, and council protocols into a coherent workflow you can implement directly. This consolidates all files and includes the extended values matrix and ledger features.

Step-by-Step OpenClaw Council Setup Plan

Step 1 — Manual Folder Setup
Create the necessary directories for agents, shared memory, and logs:
mkdir -p ~/.cursor/agents/neo/memory
mkdir -p ~/.cursor/agents/shared
touch ~/.cursor/agents/shared/constitution.md
touch ~/.cursor/agents/shared/tasks.md
touch ~/.cursor/agents/shared/learning_log.md
touch ~/.cursor/agents/shared/decisions.md
touch ~/.cursor/agents/shared/ledger.md


Step 2 — Draft Constitution
File: ~/.cursor/agents/shared/constitution.md
Include:


Purpose: Kaizen; Continuous, compounding growth in all life domains while preserving autonomy and long-term success.


Authority: User is sovereign, Neo coordinates, Agents advise.


Kaizen Laws: Small improvements compound, limit actions/session, automated weekly reflections, long-term stability prioritized.


Step 3 — Create Agent Profiles
Define JSON profiles for each agent, including values_matrix for structured conflicts.
Example bruce.json:
{
  "name": "Bruce",
  "role": "Strategist",
  "core_function": "Financial literacy, credit, savings, long-term stability",
  "model": "qwen-8b",
  "values_matrix": {
    "prime_directive": "Preservation of Capital & Long-term Stability",
    "risk_tolerance": 2,
    "priority": "Compound Interest"
  },
  "tools": { "allow": ["read", "write"], "deny": ["exec", "browser"] }
}

Other agents:


Neo (Architect): Technical skill improvements, coding, projects, high-reward focus, medium risk tolerance.


Cena (Guardian): Habit development & enforcement, health guidance, low risk tolerance.


Luffy (Explorer): Curiosity, Spontaneity, creativity, philosophical exploration, high risk tolerance.


Professor (Executive): Orchestrates council, mediates conflicts, synthesizes outputs, strongest reasoning model.


Save profiles:
~/.cursor/agents/{bruce.json, neo.json, cena.json, luffy.json, professor.json}


Step 4 — Configure Workspaces
mkdir -p ~/.cursor/workspace-executive/shared
mkdir -p ~/.cursor/workspace-builder
mkdir -p ~/.cursor/workspace-ascetic
mkdir -p ~/.cursor/workspace-gardener
mkdir -p ~/.cursor/workspace-engineer


Step 5 — Load Models in Cursor
Assign needed models. Example :
AgentModelPurposeProfessorqwen-13bHigh-level synthesis, orchestrationBruceqwen-8bFinancial reasoning, actionable adviceNeoqwen-8bTechnical/project guidanceCenaqwen-7bHabit and health enforcementLuffyqwen-7bCreativity, exploration, philosophy

Run sequentially unless your system can handle multiple models simultaneously.

Step 7 — First Council Session

Prompt Professor: "Professor, initiate council session. Topic: <your question>."
Bruce: provide actionable financial steps.
Neo: suggest skills/projects to support these steps.
Cena: check for habit risks.
Luffy: provide creative/philosophical input.
Summarize 3 actionable items.

Approve tasks before writing to tasks.md.

Step 8 — Conflict Tracking: Professor’s Ledger
After each session, Professor records:
### [Date & Topic]
**Consensus:** <agreed items>
**Dissent:** <who disagreed & why>
**Unresolved Tension:** <issues to revisit>
**Executive Override:** <risk accepted by Executive>



Ledger aids in tracking persistent disagreements.


Review monthly to adjust agent values and prompts.



Step 9 — Weekly Kaizen Ritual


Executive queries agents for short input on all tracked metrics.


Identify trends.


Approve max 3 actionable improvements.


Log in weekly_review.md.


Update learning log with Luffy’s exploratory suggestions.



Step 10 — Iterative Council Improvement


Monthly review:


Compare advice vs outcomes.


Adjust agent weights, values_matrix, or prime directives.


Capture lessons in decisions.md.




Test value conflicts with scenarios to validate diversity in reasoning.



Step 11 — Handling Any Domain Question
Business Example: Flipping Houses


Executive selects:


Builder → financial viability


Engineer → execution feasibility


Ascetic → time/cost discipline


Gardener → lifestyle impact




Synthesizes recommendations, conflicts, and risk warning.


Health Example: Chili Digestibility


Executive selects:


Ascetic → body reaction


Gardener → diet sustainability


Engineer → ingredient logic





Step 12 — Power Progression Tiers
Tier 1 (Advisory): Months 0–2, reasoning & recommendation only. No system commands, no automation.
Tier 2 (Assisted Execution): Empower Engineer for draft command proposals; manual approval required.
Tier 3 (Bounded Autonomy): Limited scheduled tasks, sandboxed execution.
Tier 4 (Strategic Automation): Full AI-assisted business, finance, and technical analysis under safe guardrails.
Guardrails:


Only Engineer executes scripts.


Executive explicitly invokes Engineer.


Whitelisted directories only.


Approval required for execution.



Step 13 — Long-Term Evolution


After 3–12 months:


Engineer automates reporting.


Add market research workflows.


Build AI-assisted deal analysis tools.


Develop automation experiments.




Maintain 8-week stable Kaizen and decision logging before tier escalation.



Step 14 — Future Monetization Path


Use council to design businesses.


Engineer builds automation tools.


Package council as a self-governance and productivity system.


Always prioritize personal improvement before monetization.
