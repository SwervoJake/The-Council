# The Council

A multi-agent decision-making system designed for continuous personal improvement across all life domains—finances, health, technical growth, and strategic planning.

## 🎯 Overview

**The Council** is a structured framework that harnesses multiple AI agents, each with specialized expertise and perspective, to provide balanced counsel on complex decisions. Rather than relying on a single viewpoint, you convene your council of experts to debate, challenge, and synthesize guidance tailored to your specific context.

**Core Mission:** Drive continuous improvement (Kaizen) while preserving autonomy, coherence, and long-term sustainable growth.

## 🤝 The Council Roster

Each agent brings a distinct philosophy and skill set to the table:

| Agent | Role | Philosophy | Key Strength |
|-------|------|------------|--------------|
| **Professor** | Executive | Pragmatic utilitarianism | Synthesizes dissent, mediates conflicts, breaks ties |
| **Neo** | Architect | EV optimization, Kaizen | Technical optimization and execution |
| **Bruce** | Strategist | Margin of safety, constructive frugality | Financial strategy and risk management |
| **Cena** | Guardian | Capacity modeling, sustainability | Health, energy, and resource allocation |
| **Luffy** | Explorer | Strategic randomness, sacred-cow disruption | Questioning assumptions and exploring unconventional paths |

## 🎯 Core Principles

1. **Kaizen (Small, Compounding Improvements)** — Incremental gains compound over time
2. **Focus Over Overwhelm** — Max 3 action items per session
3. **Structured Reflection** — Automated weekly reviews for accountability
4. **Long-term Stability > Short-term Excitement** — Sustainable growth beats quick wins
5. **Character + Systems** — Improvements must strengthen both systems and well-being
6. **User Sovereignty** — You retain final authority on all decisions

---

## 📊 When to Convene

| Situation | Recommendation |
|-----------|-----------------|
| Small, straightforward decision | Call a single agent (`Neo, Bruce, Cena, or Luffy`) |
| Big decision with multiple angles | Full council session → Use prompts from cheat sheet |
| Weekly progress check-in | `Professor, initiate weekly review.` |
| Conflict or disagreement among agents | Professor mediates and documents in Conflict Ledger |

---

## 🔧 Agent Skills

Each agent auto-applies specialized skills based on cutting-edge frameworks and research:

| Agent | Skill | Foundation |
|-------|-------|-----------|
| **Professor** | Council Synthesis | IBM Operational Decision Manager, Metaheuristics |
| **Neo** | EV Optimization | Optuna, Metaheuristics.jl |
| **Bruce** | Margin of Safety | Riskfolio-Lib, FinancePy, CVXPortfolio |
| **Cena** | Capacity Modeling | ActivityWatch, Habitica, Loop Habit |
| **Luffy** | Strategic Experiments | GrowthBook, Statsig |
